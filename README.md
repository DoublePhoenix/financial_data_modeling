# financial_data_modeling
This repository consists of example code for modeling financial data in Python. The Markowitz Portfolio Optimization, Black-Litterman model, and modules to set up or transform the portfolio parameters were implemented from scratch. The rest were examples demonstrating the use of packages such as pymc3 and arch.
